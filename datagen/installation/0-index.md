# Installation

Datagen has been built to be fully integrated with CDP, and so it deploys as a service in Cloudera Manager.

Installation can be made in two ways:

* On a running CDP cluster with CM using CSD & Parcel (See: [Installation from a CSD & a Parcel](1-installation-csd-parcel.md) )

* On a running CDP cluster with CM using deploy scripts to build it from code (See: [Installation build from source](2-installation-build-from-source.md) )


Datagen can also be run locally (or anywhere else) as a standalone server, but you will need to configure it yourself. (See: [Installation build from source](2-installation-build-from-source.md#run-locally))
